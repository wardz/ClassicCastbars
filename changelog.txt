v1.3.9:
- Bump toc version for patch 1.13.5.

- Improvements for uninterruptible cast data in Zul Gurub.

- Add option to use different settings profile per character.
- Add default list of uninterruptible NPC spells for all locales. (As a side effect your previous auto-learned uninterruptible list will be reset).
  Note that this is just some sensible defaults, it doesn't have every single uninterruptible spell in the game.


v1.3.1:
- Fix focus frame not being click-through when it's hidden after first usage.
- Minor improvements and bug fixes to uninterruptible cast system.
- Localization updates.


v1.3.0:
- Add uninterruptible cast indicator like on retail. You can configure this in the options. (SHIFT+Click the test button to force show uninterruptible castbar)
  This system works by detecting and learning from interrupt immunities. If you interrupt a casting mob and it shows "immune", the addon will
  remember this for the next time that spell is being cast and will show a grey uninterruptible spell indicator from then on. If you interrupt into bubble
  immunity this will be ignored aslong as you have LibClassicDurations enabled (should be embedded in either Details, WeakAuras or ClassicAuraDurations).
  Auto-learning is currently only enabled for NPCs, against players it will use a prebuilt list of uninterruptible spells instead. This is because there's
  so many temporary immunities for players that can give false positives. Also note that only interrupts are checked and not silences since its possible
  for a silence to be immuned while an interrupt still lands. This feature is still very much WIP, please let me know if there's any bugs or oversights.
- Add option to toggle castbar spark effect.
- Castbar spark effect is now hidden for channeled casts like on retail.
- Removed option for detecting cast speed modifiers, it is now always enabled instead.
- Removed option for showing cast info only. You can achieve the same effect by setting border texture to none, disabling spark & setting castbar background color to zero alpha value.
- Minor localization string updates & added 40% of Brazilian localizations, thanks to dalanwoopy.

- Add more French localizations, thanks to Irhala!


v1.2.7:

- Casting speed modifiers now stack like intended, also haste increases no longer affect channeled abilities.
- Castbar background will now turn from orange to slightly yellow when the cast is finished but no spell cast success event was detected (e.g when unit is out of range)
- Improved default settings for player castbar. (only updated on settings reset or fresh install)

- Fix target click trigger for focus castbar being incorrectly placed when not using default UI scale.


v1.2.3:
- War Stomp now has pushback registered again. (Thought it didn't at first)
- Add experimental focus castbar. Typing "/focus" will focus your current target and add an extra castbar for that specific unit that is always visible even if you
  no longer have that unit targetted. You may click this castbar to target your focus, however, this only works if you set the focus
  when out of combat. (If you change focus in combat it will display a red "P" next to the name until you leave combat.)
  Note that if mobs have the exact same name it will target the nearest one you're facing.
  You can also use "/click FocusCastbar" in macros to target the focus.
  You can type /clearfocus to clear your focus (or just "/focus" again while not having a target).
  You can unlock & move this frame in the options like the other castbars.
  Keep in mind this focus is heavily restricted due to API limitations, and that the max combat log range is 50 yards.

v1.1.7:
- The spell "Dark Mending" now shows a 2.0s default cast time instead of 3.5s since this one is the most used.
- Mind Quickening Gem, Berserking and Blinding Light cast speed increases are now taken into account when target buffs are visible. (friendly units/Detect Magic)
  Note that Berserking is set to always use 10% speed as the actual percentage can't really be tracked accurately.
- Castbar will now be stopped for hearthstone, resurrection and summon mount abilities when the caster receives non-DoT attacks.
- Castbar will now be stopped on any new ability used if the addon failed to detect a fakecast earlier.

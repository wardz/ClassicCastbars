v1.2.6:
- Target castbar is no longer auto reanchored on target of target frame being shown or hidden, instead it's always placed below the target of target frame area.
- Fix "Show Cast Info Only" option sometimes bugging out if you have it enabled for one type of unit frame but disabled for another.
- Casting speed modifiers now stack like intended, also haste increases no longer affect channeled abilities.
- Castbar background will now turn from orange to slightly yellow when the cast is finished but no spell cast success event was detected (e.g when unit is out of range)
- Improved default settings for player castbar. (only updated on settings reset or fresh install)
- Increased max & min values allowed for options.

- Fix target click trigger for focus castbar being incorrectly placed when not using default UI scale.


v1.2.3:
- War Stomp now has pushback registered again. (Thought it didn't at first)
- Add experimental focus castbar. Typing "/focus" will focus your current target and add an extra castbar for that specific unit that is always visible even if you
  no longer have that unit targetted. You may click this castbar to target your focus, however, this only works if you set the focus
  when out of combat. (If you change focus in combat it will display a red "P" next to the name until you leave combat.)
  Note that if mobs have the exact same name it will target the nearest one you're facing.
  You can also use "/click FocusCastbar" in macros to target the focus.
  You can type /clearfocus to clear your focus (or just "/focus" again while not having a target).
  You can unlock & move this frame in the options like the other castbars.
  Keep in mind this focus is heavily restricted due to API limitations, and that the max combat log range is 50 yards.

- Castbar will now be stopped for hearthstone, resurrection and summon mount abilities when the caster receives non-DoT attacks.
- Castbar will now be stopped on any new ability used if the addon failed to detect a fakecast earlier.

- Fix incorrect cast time for Dark Iron Bomb.

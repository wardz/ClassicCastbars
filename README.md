# ClassicCastbars

Customizable castbars for Classic & Retail World of Warcraft. Type "/castbar" to open the options panel.  
Includes optional party & nameplate castbars, school lockout alerts, and basic channel + uninterruptible cast state tracking for Classic Era.  

**Note: This addon is now in maintenance mode, expect less frequent updates.**

## Classic Era 1.15.0+

This addon is no longer needed for Classic Era to see *target* castbars. You may disable this addon now and enable castbars in `Blizzard Options -> Interface -> Show Enemy Cast Bar` instead.  

For anyone still using it for castbar customizations, make sure you're using version 1.7.2+ to support the new built in cast events.

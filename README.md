# ClassicCastbars

Customizable castbars for Classic Era, Wrath and Retail World of Warcraft. Type "/castbar" to open the options panel.  
Includes optional party castbars, school lockout alerts, and uninterruptible cast state tracking for Classic Era.  

**Note: This addon is now in maintenance mode, expect less frequent updates.**

## Classic Era 1.15.0+

This addon is no longer needed for Classic Era to see target castbars. You may safely disable this addon now and enable castbars in Blizzard Options -> Interface -> Show Enemy Cast Bar instead.  

For anyone still using it for castbar customizations, make sure you're using version 1.7.1+ to support the new built in cast events.
